I wrote a photo sharing webapp in ruby on rails for  CS 142, a web development class at Stanford. You can create a profile, tag your friends in your pictures, and add comments to people's walls. Login with a password that is salted for extra security. 

Instructions: 

rails server, open localhost:3000/users

* Ruby version : 2.1.4 rails version 4.1.7
